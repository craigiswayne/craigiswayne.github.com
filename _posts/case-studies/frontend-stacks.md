Options

3. Using react
4. Using angular

---

* Number of Node Module dependencies
* Node Modules Sizes
* Size of Files generated
* Build Time
* Load Times
* Difficulty in building assets
* Files in directory (like config files)


### What I don't like about:
1. Vue
   1. The html / javascript and styles are in specific vue components
   1. I'd prefer the html to be separate from the typescript in a separate file
   1. How do you perform style checks or typescript linting on Vue files
   2. Angular has this separation of concerns
