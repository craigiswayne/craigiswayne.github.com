Create a patch file from your git diff

## TLDR;

```git
git diff --no-prefix > my.patch
git reset --hard
patch -p0 < my.patch
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1: Make Changes

make changes to your files

### Step 2: Verify your changes

Make sure that the changes you've made are showing in the git diff

```bash
git status
git diff
```

### Step 3: Create the patch

This will create a patch for ALL the changes in the `git diff` output

```bash
git diff --no-prefix > my.patch
```

### Step 4:  

Reset the files to their original state.

We do this so that we can verify our patch works with a fresh code base.

```bash
git reset --hard
```

### Step 5: Apply your patch

```bash
patch -p0 < my.patch
```
